rxte_reduction repository

All of this is designed for RXTE PCA event-mode data. Heasoft must be installed
and CALDB must be in working order.

CONTENTS

apply_gti.py:
Applies a GTI (good times interval) to an event list. 

event_mode_bkgd.sh:
Called within rxte_reduce_data.sh. Creates a background spectrum for all the 
event-mode data and re-bins it so that the energy channels match. Also creates
the response matrix.

good_event.sh:
Decodes the binary event list and runs apply_gti.py on it. Copies filenames to 
lists.

plot_std2_lightcurve.py:
Plots a Standard-2 lightcurve, to show general trends of the data.

rxte_reduce_data.sh:
This does it all! Often times, chunks are commented out since I don't want to do
it all. Makes a list of obsIDs, creates filter files, creates GTIs, copies 
relevant raw data products to the correct new directory with sensible names, 
makes background spectra for standard-2 and event data modes, extracts 
standard-2 spectra and lightcurve and event-mode spectra and light curve. Does
the above for each obsID, and for everything all together.
